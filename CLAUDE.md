# Laravel Boost Guidelines

## Foundational Context

This application is a Laravel application running on PHP 8.4. Always use the APIs that match the installed major version of each package — do not assume a version.

Before relying on a package's API, confirm its installed version:

- PHP packages: run `composer show --direct` to list direct dependencies with versions, or `composer show <vendor/package>` for a single package.
- JS packages: check `package.json` for the installed versions.

## Skills Activation

This project has domain-specific skills available in `**/skills/**`. You MUST activate the relevant skill whenever you work in that domain—don't wait until you're stuck.

## Conventions

- You must follow all existing code conventions used in this application. When creating or editing a file, check sibling files for the correct structure, approach, and naming.
- Use descriptive names for variables and methods. For example, `isRegisteredForDiscounts`, not `discount()`.
- Check for existing components to reuse before writing a new one.

## Verification Scripts

- Do not create verification scripts or tinker when tests cover that functionality and prove they work. Unit and feature tests are more important.

## Application Structure & Architecture

- Stick to existing directory structure; don't create new base folders without approval.
- Do not change the application's dependencies without approval.

## Frontend Bundling

- If a frontend change doesn't show in the UI or you get a "Unable to locate file in Vite manifest" error, run `npm run build` or ask the user to run `npm run dev` or `composer run dev`.

## Documentation Files

- You must only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the user.

# Laravel Boost

## Tools

- Laravel Boost is an MCP server with tools designed specifically for this application. Prefer Boost tools over manual alternatives like shell commands or file reads.
- Use `database-query` to run read-only queries against the database instead of writing raw SQL in tinker.
- Use `database-schema` to inspect table structure before writing migrations or models.
- Use `get-absolute-url` to resolve the correct scheme, domain, and port for project URLs. Always use this before sharing a URL with the user.
- Use `browser-logs` to read browser logs, errors, and exceptions. Only recent logs are useful, ignore old entries.

## Searching Documentation (IMPORTANT)

- Use `search-docs` before changes that depend on Laravel ecosystem APIs, behavior, configuration, or version-specific syntax. Skip it for copy-only edits and other changes where package documentation is irrelevant. Reuse sufficient results already in context instead of searching again.
- Pass a `packages` array to scope results when you know which packages are relevant.
- Use multiple broad, topic-based queries: `['rate limiting', 'routing rate limiting', 'routing']`. Expect the most relevant results first.
- Do not add package names to queries because package info is already shared. Use `test resource table`, not `filament 4 test resource table`.

### Search Syntax

1. Use words for auto-stemmed AND logic: `rate limit` matches both "rate" AND "limit".
2. Use `"quoted phrases"` for exact position matching: `"infinite scroll"` requires adjacent words in order.
3. Combine words and phrases for mixed queries: `middleware "rate limit"`.
4. Use multiple queries for OR logic: `queries=["authentication", "middleware"]`.

## Project Rules

- This project contains committed, area-grouped rules in `.ai/rules` when that directory exists, including path-scoped framework guidelines under `.ai/rules/boost`. Before you enter plan mode or create/edit any file, you MUST first: open @.ai/rules/index.md (it maps file globs to rule files), read every rule file whose globs cover the path(s) in scope, and run `grep -rin 'keyword' .ai/rules` to catch what a path match alone misses. Do not write code until you have read and are following every matching rule. If `.ai/rules` does not exist, continue without it.

## Artisan

- Run Artisan commands directly via the command line (e.g., `php artisan route:list`). Use `php artisan list` to discover available commands and `php artisan [command] --help` to check parameters.
- Inspect routes with `php artisan route:list`. Filter with: `--method=GET`, `--name=users`, `--path=api`, `--except-vendor`, `--only-vendor`.
- Read configuration values using dot notation: `php artisan config:show app.name`, `php artisan config:show database.default`. Or read config files directly from the `config/` directory.

## Tinker

- Execute PHP in app context for debugging and testing code. Do not create models without user approval, prefer tests with factories instead. Prefer existing Artisan commands over custom tinker code.
- Always use single quotes to prevent shell expansion: `php artisan tinker --execute 'Your::code();'`
    - Double quotes for PHP strings inside: `php artisan tinker --execute 'User::where("active", true)->count();'`

=== php rules ===

# PHP

- Always use curly braces for control structures, even for single-line bodies.
- Use PHP 8 constructor property promotion: `public function __construct(public GitHub $github) { }`. Do not leave empty zero-parameter `__construct()` methods unless the constructor is private.
- Use explicit return type declarations and type hints for all method parameters: `function isAccessible(User $user, ?string $path = null): bool`
- Use TitleCase for Enum keys: `FavoritePerson`, `BestLake`, `Monthly`.
- Prefer PHPDoc blocks over inline comments. Only add inline comments for exceptionally complex logic.
- Use array shape type definitions in PHPDoc blocks.

=== deployments rules ===

# Deployment

- Laravel can be deployed using [Laravel Cloud](https://cloud.laravel.com/), which is the fastest way to deploy and scale production Laravel applications.

=== inertia-laravel/core rules ===

# Inertia

- Inertia creates fully client-side rendered SPAs without modern SPA complexity, leveraging existing server-side patterns.
- Components live in `resources/js/pages` (unless specified in `vite.config.js`). Use `Inertia::render()` for server-side routing instead of Blade views.
- ALWAYS use `search-docs` tool for version-specific Inertia documentation and updated code examples.
- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia client-side patterns.

# Inertia v3

- Use all Inertia features from v1, v2, and v3. Check the documentation before making changes to ensure the correct approach.
- New v3 features: standalone HTTP requests (`useHttp` hook), optimistic updates with automatic rollback, layout props (`useLayoutProps` hook), instant visits, simplified SSR via `@inertiajs/vite` plugin, custom exception handling for error pages.
- Carried over from v2: deferred props, infinite scroll, merging props, polling, prefetching, once props, flash data.
- When using deferred props, add an empty state with a pulsing or animated skeleton.
- Axios has been removed. Use the built-in XHR client with interceptors, or install Axios separately if needed.
- `Inertia::lazy()` / `LazyProp` has been removed. Use `Inertia::optional()` instead.
- Prop types (`Inertia::optional()`, `Inertia::defer()`, `Inertia::merge()`) work inside nested arrays with dot-notation paths.
- SSR works automatically in Vite dev mode with `@inertiajs/vite` - no separate Node.js server needed during development.
- Event renames: `invalid` is now `httpException`, `exception` is now `networkError`.
- `router.cancel()` replaced by `router.cancelAll()`.
- The `future` configuration namespace has been removed - all v2 future options are now always enabled.

=== laravel/core rules ===

# Do Things the Laravel Way

- Use `php artisan make:` commands to create new files (i.e. migrations, controllers, models, etc.). You can list available Artisan commands using `php artisan list` and check their parameters with `php artisan [command] --help`.
- If you're creating a generic PHP class, use `php artisan make:class`.
- Pass `--no-interaction` to all Artisan commands to ensure they work without user input. You should also pass the correct `--options` to ensure correct behavior.

### Model Creation

- When creating new models, create useful factories and seeders for them too. Ask the user if they need any other things, using `php artisan make:model --help` to check the available options.

## APIs & Eloquent Resources

- For APIs, default to using Eloquent API Resources and API versioning unless existing API routes do not, then you should follow existing application convention.

## URL Generation

- When generating links to other pages, prefer named routes and the `route()` function.

## Testing

- When creating models for tests, use the factories for the models. Check if the factory has custom states that can be used before manually setting up the model.
- Faker: Use methods such as `$this->faker->word()` or `fake()->randomDigit()`. Follow existing conventions whether to use `$this->faker` or `fake()`.
- When creating tests, make use of `php artisan make:test [options] {name}` to create a feature test, and pass `--unit` to create a unit test. Most tests should be feature tests.

=== pint/core rules ===

# Laravel Pint Code Formatter

- If you have modified any PHP files, you must run `vendor/bin/pint --dirty --format agent` before finalizing changes to ensure your code matches the project's expected style.
- Do not run `vendor/bin/pint --test --format agent`, simply run `vendor/bin/pint --format agent` to fix any formatting issues.

=== phpunit/core rules ===

# PHPUnit

- This project uses PHPUnit. Create tests with `php artisan make:test --phpunit {name}`.
- Do not include the test suite directory in `{name}`. Use `SomeFeatureTest`, not `Feature/SomeFeatureTest`.
- Read the `testing-best-practices` skill for guidance on coverage, naming, structure, dependency isolation, and review.

## Running Tests

- Run the narrowest set of tests that covers the change. Pass a file path or `--filter=testName` to `php artisan test --compact`.
- Rerun a test after each change to it.
- Run `vendor/bin/phpunit` to call the test runner directly. It accepts the same file path and `--filter=testName` arguments.

=== inertia-react/core rules ===

# Inertia + React

- IMPORTANT: Activate `inertia-react-development` when working with Inertia React client-side patterns.

=== cubeta/cubeta-starter/core rules ===

## Cubeta Starter

Cubeta Starter (`cubeta/cubeta-starter`) is a Laravel **code generator**, required as a `--dev`
dependency. It scaffolds a full CRUD "slice" for a model — migration, model, form request/DTO, api
resource, factory, seeder, repository, service, controller, web controller and feature test — from
`php artisan create:*` commands, following a Repository + Service design.

The full documentation source ships with the package itself as plain Markdown at
`vendor/cubeta/cubeta-starter/docs/*.md` — read those files directly for anything not covered here
or in the `cubeta-starter-development` skill, especially `commands.md`, `usage.md`,
`configuration.md`, `permissions-usage.md` and `troubleshooting.md`. The same content is also
published at **https://cubeta-io.github.io/cubeta-starter/** if a rendered/browsable version is
preferred.

### Critical rule: never depend on the package's own namespace at runtime

`Cubeta\CubetaStarter\*` (its classes, enums, constants, facades, helper functions, GUI
routes/controllers, everything under the package's own `src/`) is a **build-time tool only**. Do
**not**:

- add a `use Cubeta\CubetaStarter\...;` import anywhere in the host application's code,
- call, extend, or reference any `Cubeta\CubetaStarter\*` class/enum/constant/function from
  application code (models, controllers, requests, tests, config, service providers, etc.),
- rely on the package being present outside of local/dev (`composer require cubeta/cubeta-starter
--dev`) — it must not be required for the app to boot or run in production.

This does **not** apply to the files the commands _publish/generate into the host app_ (e.g.
`app/Http/Resources/BaseResource/BaseResource.php`, `app/Modules/ApiResponse.php`,
`app/Http/Controllers/ApiController.php`, and every generated model/controller/repository/service).
Once generated, those live in the host app's own `App\` namespace and are yours to use, extend and
edit freely — only the `Cubeta\CubetaStarter\*` package code itself is off-limits.

### One-time stack setup

Before generating model files, the relevant stack must be installed once:

<code-snippet name="Install stacks" lang="shell">
php artisan cubeta:install api                 # base api scaffolding
php artisan cubeta:install web                 # base blade scaffolding
php artisan cubeta:install react-ts             # Inertia + React + TypeScript scaffolding
php artisan cubeta:install permissions          # spatie/laravel-permission + role scaffolding
php artisan cubeta:install auth v1 api          # auth endpoints for the given container
</code-snippet>

### Generating a model and its CRUD files

`create:model` is the main entry point and, by default, generates every related file. Every
`create:*` command also works standalone (e.g. `create:migration` to only add a migration to an
existing model). See the `cubeta-starter-development` skill for the full per-command reference, or
`php artisan help <command>`.

Run every command as a single non-interactive line: pass every argument explicitly plus `--force`
(overwrite existing files) and `--no-interaction` (skip any prompt and fall back to safe defaults
instead of hanging):

<code-snippet name="Generate a full model (model, migration, request, resource, factory, seeder, repository, service, controller, test)" lang="shell">
php artisan create:model Post "title:string,body:text,category_id:key,is_published:boolean" "" "slug" "comments:hasMany" none api --force --no-interaction
</code-snippet>

Argument order for `create:model` (and most `create:*` commands): `name attributes nullables
uniques relations actor container`.

### Argument formats

- **attributes** — `"field:type,field2:type2,..."`. Supported types: integer, bigInteger,
  unsignedBigInteger, double, float, string, text, json, boolean, date, time, dateTime, timestamp,
  file, key, translatable. A `key` column (e.g. `category_id`) automatically creates a `belongsTo`
  relation and foreign id migration column — do not also list it in `relations`.
- **relations** — `"relatedModel:relationType,..."`. Supported types: belongsTo, hasMany, hasOne,
  manyToMany.
- **nullables** / **uniques** — comma separated column names, e.g. `"slug,description"`.
- **actor** — the role allowed to use the generated endpoints (see `create:actor`), or `"none"`.
- **container** — `api`, `web` or `both`.

Full command reference: `php artisan list create`, `php artisan help <command>`, the
`cubeta-starter-development` skill, or `vendor/cubeta/cubeta-starter/docs/commands.md`.

=== maatwebsite/excel/core rules ===

# Laravel Excel

- Use `maatwebsite/excel` for spreadsheet exports, imports, queued spreadsheet work, CSV handling, and PhpSpreadsheet integration in Laravel applications.
- Prefer explicit export/import classes with package concerns over ad-hoc spreadsheet generation in controllers, jobs, or commands.
- Activate the `laravel-excel` skill when working with `Excel::download()`, `Excel::store()`, `Excel::queue()`, `Excel::raw()`, `Excel::import()`, `Excel::toArray()`, `Excel::toCollection()`, export/import concerns, queued imports/exports, validation, CSV settings, styling, events, formulas, charts, drawings, multiple sheets, mapped cells, macros, config, cache, transactions, temporary files, or `Excel::fake()`.
- For broad docs, all-feature tasks, or missing-feature audits, use the skill's `references/package.md` feature matrix before answering.
- For large datasets, prefer `FromQuery` with queued exports or `WithChunkReading` and `WithBatchInserts` for imports.
- Test spreadsheet behavior with `Excel::fake()` when asserting dispatch/download/store/import intent, and inspect generated files only when cell contents, formatting, sheets, or writer behavior must be proven.
